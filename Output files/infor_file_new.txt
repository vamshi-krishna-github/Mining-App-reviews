lensix ratingtwo keep pressing back key by mistake.

lensixteen ratingtwo cant select and copy text  cant save images easily like ios by long pressing on image

lennineteen ratingtwo its good app, but please make it to move to sd card as it consumes 30mb space on my phone.

lennine ratingone this app is so god awful, it offends me.

lensixteen ratingone facebooks has millions of dollars and your developers cant even release a half way decent app.

lensix ratingone now the app wont even load.

lenten ratingone get it together facebook, stop treating your members like crap!

lennineteen ratingone mu  i can't mention people i'm disappointed much bettet if i don't update it really sich

lenfive ratingone needs to be badly upgraded.

lentwentytwo ratingone photos rarely open, have to close the app to refresh it and even then most of the time it won't work.

lenfive ratingone needs a lot of work.

lensix ratingone just sucks in so many ways

lenthirtysix ratingthree great app its just when i update a status its say via mobile instead of what city i'm in i would love my friends to know i'm in their town so please change that

leneleven ratingone this is by far the worst upgrade i have ever had.

lenseven ratingtwo keeps on freezing once and a while

lenthree ratingone it deserves 1 star (;

lenfour ratingtwo like really, really slow.

lenthirtyfive ratingone for example anyone running 4.1+ is in one group so a fb app just for that would address and fix issues for phones such as my note2 without compromising the functionality of phones with older android os

lentwentytwo ratingthree now all it needs is the abilities to share status', share to other people's walls and pages, and copy/paste function.

lenfourteen ratingthree i cant share to my own group, or anywhere but my own wall.ugh

leneleven ratingone show photo album name photo was uploaded to on facebook page

lensix ratingtwo could use a lot of improving /:

leneighteen ratingone first review was: another bugged app update that now won't load up comments or user home pages.

lenthree ratingone "network connection error".

lentwentyone ratingone for such a huge corporation you get no points for rolling out dysfunctional software and should be ashamed of your app.

lennine ratingfour there's a lot of things that needs improvement.

lenthirteen ratingfour one of them is that you can't even change your profile picture.

lensixteen ratingfour you should also have the option for being able to post pictures and videos on groups.

lenfourteen ratingthree if i could move it to my sd card i would rate it 5 stars.

lenfiftytwo ratingone not liking the new camera app, all they need to do is change the icon or the name, as i can see some people uploading not for public pics esp if they've had a bit to drink, why call it camera and make the icon look like a default camera app?

lennine ratingthree the last version was perfect this one is cluttered!



lenfourteen ratingfour The only thing that would make this app perfect is to add video chat.

lenthirteen ratingone I had this version on my galaxy note and it wouldn't update.

lentwentyone ratingone Slow load time (refreshing the newsfeed is agonising) and can't view photos over 3g network. Same issues if using wi-fi.

lenfive ratingtwo Sometimes it even force closes.

lenthirtyfour ratingtwo I feel like way earlier versions were so much better, now the designers are so busy trying to make it twitter that they're losing focus on simple tasks like loading a friggin picture?

lentwentythree ratingone Not only does it not show me peoples status' in order, but it won't let me check in OR update my status.

lenfive ratingfour The app became really faster.

lensix ratingfour Much improved but still give 4 stars.

lenseventeen ratingtwo Wish I didnt have to keep deleting and reinstalling this app just so I can see pics.

leneight ratingtwo Also my comments lag, dissappear, and reappear whenever.

lenseven ratingtwo Notifications are all out of wack too.

lenfiftysix ratingthree It keeps getting better but I find it difficult if not impossible to do certain simple tasks such as setting a cover photo or removing an accidental photo tag that you might have created or even scrolling through the profile pictures when your not viewing the album itself when you click on someone's profile picture.

lentwenty ratingtwo This version is garbage, you cannot add a cover photo through profile, default pics dont fully show, and other problems.

lennine ratingone Not to mention all the data it soaks up.

lenseventeen ratingone I am now deleting it because everyday it freezes and force closes at least 3 times a day.

lentwelve ratingone Maybe i need other app to notify me when i get notification.

lenthirteen ratingone It takes very much space please add feature to send to SD card ....!!

lenthirteen ratingthree 40+ mb's is a big chunk to have on my phone's memory.

lentwentyfive ratingone Not getting notifications, the app will have a "network error" when not on wireless, the picture zoom has glitched, and a bunch of missing info.

leneighteen ratingone If I try to log out of the app to fix it, I can't log back in.

lenfourteen ratingone I have to reboot my entire phone to get the error to go away

lenseven ratingtwo Could improve on speed and memory usage.

lenthree ratingtwo Force closes often.

lentwentytwo ratingthree But key functions of this version are removed such as the ability to delete comments of yours or others on your statuses.

leneleven ratingtwo FB is always pushing how much info they can send you.

lenfourteen ratingtwo I wish this app had more controls for what one would like to receive.

lentwelve ratingtwo I wish it had an option to not load at start up...

lenfourteen ratingone This is the only app that continuously freezes my phone and stops it responding

lenthirteen ratingone Facebook keeps saying no network and dosen't load pictures update is useless!!!

lenten ratingone It doesn't capture my location automatically on my updates...

leneighteen ratingone Also when I like some status it doesn't appear when I see the same status next time.

lenfive ratingone pics take forever to load

lenthirteen ratingone 10  not changing # of stars and now still cant update the statuses as well

lentwelve ratingfour feels a bit sluggish when scrolling ;( but the speed has defiantly increased

lentwentytwo ratingfour the truth of the matter is facebook needs to put the same effort they put into ios that they put into android

leneight ratingone i uninstalled then reinstalled, worked like a champ

lennine ratingtwo using too much internal memory everytime you release updates

lenthree ratingfive uygulama s¨¹per hatta baz

lentwentysix ratingone 1 in galaxy s3 n i hav kept option of chat availabiliy on during using the facebook app but i never appears online to my friends plz help

lenfour ratingfour a great ux overall

lenthirtyfour ratingfour but we could really use a few fixes like clicking the apps from the sidebar opens them in play store rather than opening the app itself (this happened when i tried to open soundcloud )

lenseven ratingthree because of uploading speed is very slow

lenten ratingone the worst after the last update, if you log off

leneight ratingone i hope the first virsion to be returned

lenseven ratingone im, like most people, a facebook addict

lensix ratingone wont even connect half the time

lensixteen ratingtwo when i try to back up out of a picture i have to press back 5 times

lentwelve ratingtwo sometimes when i opened the app its hang then go to crash

lenfour ratingtwo stay with previous version

lenthirtysix ratingthree if you have hundreds of friends who post a lot, the news feed keeps resetting every few seconds and you can never finish scrolling down to read the statuses before it goes back to the top

lenten ratingfive all works are automatically done here and automstic udates etc

lenfive ratingfive thnx fb snd thnx android

leneight ratingthree is anyone else havin problems with pictures loading

lentwentyfour ratingone it would be more efficient to engrave a rock and kick it over to their mailbox as to attempt to comment, like, or etc

lensix ratingone i can not change profile picture

lentwelve ratingone won't post updates the first time, have to copy, paste, repost

leneight ratingone are you purposely making this app suck balls

leneleven ratingone pics don't load, comments don't load, won't refresh

lenseven ratingone everytime i try to use this app

lentwelve ratingtwo i keep jumping from yourself app to face book on the internet

lenseven ratingtwo either way your product is seriously frustrating

lenseven ratingtwo your app frequently doesn't allow comments

lennine ratingtwo the internet product ignores all my block settings etc

leneleven ratingtwo i am seriously thinking of not bothering anymore with mobile facebook

lenfive ratingone can't change cover picture

lentwentysix ratingfour i have apparently not the latest version of facebook app on my android device as it keeps trying to update it, but it says "unsufficient storage"

lentwenty ratingfour which is false, i do have a lot of storage available, and it's the online app to not update

lensixteen ratingfour all others have been updated with no problem, and fb keeps saying this for 2 weeks now

lenseven ratingone the simpler facebook was fast and easy

lensixteen ratingone do away with timeline also no video that is posted by my phone or anyone elses

lenten ratingone i know this stuff takes time but come on already

lensix ratingone app crashes when viewing photos etc

lenfive ratingone don't want this bull

lenfive ratingtwo i bought a galaxy note 10

lensixteen ratingtwo 1 tablet hoping tbat facebook would be far easier to use when away from my laptop/desktop

lenseventeen ratingtwo sadly it's fair to say that the latest version of facebook on a samsung galaxy note 10

lenthirteen ratingtwo 1 is probably one of the worse experiences that i've had to endure

lennineteen ratingone i have these little white boxes everywhere and it won't let me get to my timeline, messages, etc

lenthirteen ratingone can pls pls pls fix the bugs on the fb app for android

lensix ratingone :(( using sony ericsson by the way

leneleven ratingone basically all i can do is scroll through the news feed

lenfive ratingone cant even check my notifications

leneleven ratingtwo 90% of the time when i click on a picture, it says

lennine ratingtwo it can not retrieve the photo at this time

lennine ratingone no location is recorded when posting a status update

lensix ratingone cantt upload pictures and post pictures

lensix ratingone eats lot of memory and battery

lenthirteen ratingone using the browser is much better than the app :p unistalling the app

leneight ratingone latest update is completely a piece of shit

lenseven ratingthree ok app but need to fix some

lenthirteen ratingone always in waiting mode, pics won't show up, posts don't post

lenthree ratingone app lags alot

leneight ratingone update should be better not make it worst

leneight ratingone it doesn't upload my status nor pictures

lenten ratingone really annoying that i can only upload pictures from instagram

lennineteen ratingtwo things cause it will unlike can't change timeline pic, slow & takes to long to load & look at pics

lenfourteen ratingone now when i upload pics i get an error yet the picture still uploads

lentwenty ratingone it doesn't refresh the way it used to, the location disappeared, and it's very delayed when sending notifications

lensix ratingone facebook apps is not responding right

lennine ratingone i can't post status on my wall now

lenfourteen ratingone what's the point of using the app if you can't see pictures

lenten ratingone i cant see pics, its slower && makes my phone sloww -

lentwentyone ratingone gonna delete      somehere, probably when i last updated fbook, the app autochecked the box for auto updates, which i never do

lennineteen ratingone ever since the last update i can't are any pix on the news feed or my profile page

lensix ratingone the cell tower thing is cute

leneight ratingthree keeps crashing when looking at pics and events

lenseven ratingone mobile pictures or only on old albums

leneight ratingone half of my news feed doesn't appear

lensix ratingone i can't view comment threads

lentwentyseven ratingthree I never posted a low review of the Facebook app before because even though it didn't do everything I wanted it to, at least it worked.

lentwo ratingfour Excellent app.....

leneight ratingone When this app went native, it was fine.

lensix ratingone Two updates afterwards, its HORRIBLE again.

leneleven ratingone The worst app I've ever had the displeasure of downloading.

lenseven ratingone Surely it should be better than this?

lenfour ratingone This last update sucks!

lenfour ratingone I hate this app.

leneighteen ratingthree if I use facebook on my phone but with the browser not the app everything shows up fine

leneight ratingone Didnt even want to give it one star.

lenten ratingtwo But a good in disguise is the page loads faster

lenseven ratingone not satisfied with the app right now

lenfour ratingtwo This app is garbage.

lenthree ratingone Worst update ever..

lentwentyone ratingfour After using this on the Droid X, CyanogenMod 7 and 10 (Nook color), and Droid Razr HD, still product seems stable for me.

lennine ratingfour I love facebook i wil never stop using facebook

lenfour ratingone This app is beat.

lenfive ratingone The last verison was better.

leneight ratingone Everything worked fine until about a week ago.

leneight ratingone After an update it becames annoying and useless...

lenfive ratingfour Nothing more need Be said.

lennine ratingone You cant change it evertime its updated it sucks.

lenseven ratingone Why fix something that wasn't broken??

lenthree ratingone Facebook app sucks!

lenthree ratingone Worse update ever

lenten ratingone restarted phone still no work I am seriously not happy!

lenthree ratingone Doesn't update.

lenseven ratingone I'm using the web page now.

lennine ratingone How long will it take to fix this bug????

lentwentyfour ratingone I can only assume that a company with the resources of FB would release an app when it does what they want it to.

lennineteen ratingone Which leads to the  question of why would you want to release an app that's a complete mess?

lenthree ratingone Lousy Share implementation?

lensix ratingone shame they call it an update!!!

lentwo ratingone Seriously unhappy.

leneight ratingthree In a MOBILE app that is incredibly lame.

lennine ratingone The past two upgrades have made Facebook run horribly.

lennine ratingone Please revert to old version that actually was reliable.

lenthirteen ratingtwo This update is taking years to open due to this airtime is wasting....

lentwelve ratingfour I really good for people who are not on computers a lot.

lenseventeen ratingthree App is very sluggish does what it's supposed to but with every update it gets worse.

leneight ratingone Earlier version was little bit faster than this..

lenfive ratingone It should be corrected asap..

lentwo ratingone Updates sucks...

lenten ratingone You are currently the #1 social networking site in the world...

lennine ratingone im deleting my account if this isn't fixed!!!!

lensix ratingone Very bad, fix all the bugs!!!!!!

lensix ratingtwo u guys nid to fix this!

lennine ratingthree This app is just a wrapper for the website.

lenfifteen ratingthree If you want to satisfy users (and raise your stock prices) fix your mobile apps.

lenten ratingthree Otherwise people may move to google+, which is gaining ground.

lenthirteen ratingthree Mobile browsing is now bigger than computer browsing, and your screwing it up.

lenthree ratingone Time to UNINSTALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

lenfour ratingone I hate fb app..

lensix ratingtwo It's a very irritating app.

lenfive ratingtwo That may lose your temper.

lenfifteen ratingone So facebook, you had a really good update so why'd you make another one?

lenfive ratingone Facebook is really crappy now.

lenseven ratingone It was working fine until I updated.

leneight ratingone It's better to access fb via browser...

lenfifteen ratingone There are no regular updates from d developers even d updates didn't change much..

lentwenty ratingone Yes, I use Facebook, but there are better alternatives for using it on Android, thanks to FB's developers API.

lenfive ratingone Wait for the next version.

lensix ratingone This most recent update is AWFUL.

lentwentyseven ratingtwo The privacy invasion of this app make me often use the fb site from my phone b/c of the list of when everyone was last on.

leneight ratingone you guys fix a problem n create another.

lensix ratingone update made it worster thn evr.......

lenten ratingone one of the must commonly used apps that people use.

lentwo ratingone CHOPPER EXCHANGE.

leneight ratingone Fix it or im getting rid of it.

lenseven ratingone Thougth updates were supposed to improve things?????

lenseven ratingtwo I'm sick of this crap app.

lentwo ratingtwo seriously Mark!!

lenfive ratingone it worked besutifully for awhile.

lenten ratingone These kind of errors should not be happening from Facebook.

lenfifteen ratingfour Now I can go to Facebook with out searchon the internet and it is faster .

lenfour ratingone It behaves like malware.

leneight ratingone Please fix because overall the app is great.

lensix ratingtwo I do not like this "update."

lensixteen ratingfour Its better than gettin on the internet when you could just get on it on demand

lensix ratingone Looking forward to it being fixed.

lenthree ratingtwo Great on iphones?!

lenseven ratingtwo Please fix this issue for android users!!!

lenfourteen ratingone So I'm re installing it, hopefully it'll actually let me go on.

lennine ratingone This has to be the worst app i have...

lennine ratingone Agree with all the bad reviews of this app.

lenseven ratingone The last update made the app useless.

lenten ratingone My girlfriend has the same issue on her nexus s.

lenten ratingone Fix it bc I'm about to delete the app.

leneight ratingthree Upgraded my phone, have a Samsung Galaxy S2 now.

lenfifteen ratingthree It still gives me problems once in awhile, but not enough to uninstall the app.

leneleven ratingone I always send the error report and obviously nothing gets fixed.

lenfive ratingone Such a piece of krap.

lennine ratingone Im about to not even use fb any more

leneight ratingone Almost speechless on how bad this app is...!

lensix ratingtwo pls fix this bug FB team..

lenfive ratingone hope you guys fix it...

lentwo ratingone Poor app

lenten ratingone Test connection on browser or other apps, everything is ok.

lennine ratingone This is a critical bug, pls fix it soon.

lennine ratingone So many updates and none have fixed the problem.

lentwenty ratingone Yeah, i don't want to look at photos anyways, so your app is pretty helpful in that regard (sarcasms).

leneight ratingone You are making it into a bad app!

lennine ratingone This app is getting worse and worse each day.

lentwelve ratingthree This app has improved however, it still has a way to go.

lenthirteen ratingthree I long for an app with the stability and functionality of the website.

lensix ratingthree Keep up the progress developer team.

lenfour ratingone Needs an update asap.....

lensix ratingtwo Every update gets worse and worse...

lennine ratingthree Fix this and we'll all be much happier.

lenseven ratingone The most recent update is so awful.

leneleven ratingone The update before the most recent was by far the best.

lentwelve ratingone I dont see how the updates make tis app better of faster.

lensix ratingtwo Doesnt let me update the app!

leneight ratingtwo Facebook and google need to start getting along.

lenthree ratingfour Fb is great

lennine ratingtwo I am uninstalling this app and going to Friendcaster.

lentwelve ratingone Only way to fix for me was to un install the app.

lennine ratingone Fb for android is consistently getting worse and worse.

lenseven ratingone I mean seriously people fix it already.

leneleven ratingone Don't know why it works this way, but very annoying.

lenthree ratingone Worst update ever.

lenfour ratingone Need a new update!

lenfive ratingtwo Pretty crappy for galaxy siii

lenten ratingone Stop trying to make money and make your apps work?

lenseven ratingone Always something with this piece of crap..

lennineteen ratingfour I was trying to uninstall my facebook app because it was so crappy when I came across this update.

lenseven ratingfour I absolutely love my facebook app now!

lenseven ratingfour No more mobile internet Facebook  for me;-)

lenfour ratingone App is useless now!

lensix ratingone You had that in previous versions.

lentwelve ratingone Every new update comes with a new error to the facebook app

lenthirteen ratingthree The Facebook App is improved from before, I enjoy the faster picture loading.

lenten ratingtwo but we all know FB would never be that considerate.

lentwo ratingone Pathetic update

lentwentynine ratingone This piece of carp app is sheet it's forking frustrating it was fine when they originally released the major update but now it's a piece of sheet.

lenfive ratingone Fix your sheet Facebook developers.

lenseven ratingone I prefer use my old facebook app....

leneight ratingthree Other then that its still a great app.

lenten ratingtwo Commenting on a photo from mobile is good and working ...

lennine ratingtwo need a solution for this A. S. A. P

lenfive ratingone Look I''ll be honest.....

leneight ratingone I like the new look, feel and features....

leneleven ratingone No matter the update, it never works right on my phone.

lenthree ratingone This app sucks!!!

leneight ratingone And is there anyway to contact the developers?

lenfour ratingone And is completely annoying.

lentwo ratingfour nice apps....

leneight ratingfour Facebook on android is getting poorer and poorer!

lenseven ratingfour $60billion company can't get an app right!

lensix ratingfour Significant improvement since version 1.0 or so.

lenfour ratingtwo You're getting there...

lenten ratingone Pleaseee FIX and will rate again based on the fix.

leneight ratingtwo I am totally fed up after updating it...

lensix ratingtwo The last version was much better...

lenthirteen ratingone I don't like it at all, I want the old version please!!

lenten ratingone Cmon guys I know you can do better than this.

lenthree ratingone THIS UPDATE SUCKS!!!!!

lenfourteen ratingone I WOULD ACTUALLY PAY MONEY TO DELETE THIS UPDATE, I HATE IT THIS MUCH!!!!

leneight ratingtwo With every update the app gets worse & worse..

lensix ratingone Last view updates have been junk.

leneighteen ratingone Apparently you all just don't have time for us or have the courtesy to fix our problems.

lenfive ratingone I'm uninstalling this app..

lenfive ratingfour People just need to relax.

lenthirteen ratingfour It is not going to be able to do everything a computer can.

leneight ratingfour The app itself has gotten a lot faster.

lenseven ratingfour But that is not facebook's fault.

lenseven ratingfour Love the features they are adding too.

lenseven ratingone Just updated this app and guess what?

lenfour ratingone This app just SHITY!!!!!!

lenthirteen ratingone The app is free, I would hate to have to pay for it!!!!!!

lennine ratingone Agree with everything every one else had said here.

lennine ratingone I recommend others not to update to this version.

lenfour ratingthree A little bit Better

lenthirteen ratingthree What's the point in that feature if it's wrong every time!?

lensix ratingfour Am in luv with this app

lenthirteen ratingthree The new updated version of FB is freaking the nuts out of me.

lentwenty ratingthree If I'm putting a comment against a pic or an update, why the hell can't I remove it??

lenthirteen ratingone I think its time to go back to basics because this app sucks.

lenten ratingfour App is way easier to use  than my Web browser

lentwo ratingone Bad update

leneight ratingthree Better than previous updates, but still not great.

lensixteen ratingthree It's working today but I've learned not to update if it can be helped.

lenthree ratingfour A lot better!

lenfourteen ratingfour Sharing to other pages is fantastic, thanks for finally adding share and share options

lenthree ratingfour Update is ok..

lensixteen ratingfour Everyone is telling a problem but there is no problem for me it just works better

lensix ratingone No stars for u guys, today...

lenfourteen ratingone Why not scratch this entire app and design a new one that actually works.

lenseven ratingfour This wasnt this way before the update!

leneighteen ratingthree I was so excited when the newest update came up because I thought it would fix the problem.

lenfour ratingfour No idea what happened...

lenthree ratingfour Sharing is awesome

lentwelve ratingone I like that I can use the app for about ten minutes.

lenfour ratingone I hate this update.

lenfourteen ratingthree There seems to be a lot of reviews on how bad the updates are

lennine ratingfour I seriously can't believe it's this smooth!

lensix ratingfour You should definitely fix it soon.

lensix ratingthree Its been alot better since update!

leneleven ratingthree still d andriod app is really missing lot of interesting feature..

lenseven ratingone There is nothing wrong with my phone.

lenfourteen ratingone I Cant send pictures threw messages and it always says network error it sucks.

lenfourteen ratingone My I phone version was way better this don't even deserve a rate!

lenthirteen ratingtwo Only works for like 2 minutes before messing up the rest of the day!

lentwo ratingone 12-20-12 update sucks!

lenthirteen ratingone All functionality seems to be here,  including deleting posts,  sharing,  seeing online contacts.

lensixteen ratingone Needs to be fixed but don't rush it, take your time and fix it correctly.

lensix ratingtwo im better off browsing thru chrome.

lenfour ratingone So sorry I updated.

leneight ratingone I wish I could go back an update.

lenfive ratingone You ruined my facebook app!

lentwelve ratingone I thought uninstalling the app and downloading it again would maybe help.

lenten ratingone Please correct the problems associated with the most recent update.

lenseven ratingone Just revert back to the old version.

lenseven ratingone Have reinstalled 3 times and still having problems.

lenfive ratingone The old version was fine!

lenfive ratingone Cant do anything i like.

lenthree ratingone Worst update ever.

leneighteen ratingone I literally have to use my browser and go on Facebook to do any of these simple things!

lenseven ratingone It's just a little bit ridiculous.

lentwelve ratingthree The speed is better, but it's still has to many errors.

lenthree ratingone New version sucks

lenfifteen ratingone It's getting to the point where all these updates are actually hurting the app.

lennineteen ratingtwo Shows what it pleases, when it pleases, and takes very little notice of what you ask it to do.

lentwo ratingfour Nice application......

lenfive ratingtwo So good bye for awhile.

lensix ratingone The Facebook app is truly rubbish.

lentwo ratingone Totally useless!

lensix ratingfour Have to turn on laptop everytime....

leneight ratingone I am not happy with this latest version.

lennine ratingone Much easier to go on facebook with my browser.

lentwelve ratingthree Tweeter application is much better to load ans save the data syncronisation.

lentwentytwo ratingone are you sure that you aren't part of Microsoft as this is the kind of shambolic update they would send out.

leneight ratingfour Good lets me talk to my friend so

lentwo ratingthree Getting better.

lenthree ratingfour Update is brilliant..

lenfourteen ratingtwo I really wish I could uninstall this update because of how much it sucks.

leneight ratingone garbage, and why does it say "TOP DEVELOPER"?!

lentwelve ratingfour Great way to keep in touch with people all over the globe

lensix ratingfour The new message chat is great!!

lenthirteen ratingfour I would say it gives superv interface layer out which is too good.

lensix ratingfour Do this n ill rate 5 stars

lenfive ratingfour The android app is awesome

leneleven ratingone I actually waited a year since i last downloaded this app.

lentwo ratingone Facebook SUCKS!

leneleven ratingone Shittiest app ever if I could I would give it -5 stars.

lenten ratingfour I don't see any problems with the latest update.

leneleven ratingfour Seems to be a lot quicker and like the new layout.

lentwo ratingone Super annoying.

lenfive ratingone This app really is sh**

lenten ratingtwo The Facebook app is not consistent with desktop's formula.

lentwelve ratingtwo As a developer,  they really need to test these updates before releasing.

leneight ratingtwo Stop fixing it if it's not broken.

leneight ratingfour Simple and it has all the important functions.

leneight ratingone This app was fantastic before the last update

lenseven ratingthree Not all that bad it is nice

leneight ratingone Use the browser version or a 3rd party app

lennine ratingtwo Good app but I've chosen to unistall vs.

lensix ratingone I completly unhappy with this app.

leneight ratingone Terrible and it needs fixing bad and fast.

lentwelve ratingone I just use a book mark now much easier and actually works.

lenfive ratingfour The updates are always terrible.

lennineteen ratingfour Instead of moving the gui around a thousand times, how about you work on how the actual app runs.

lenfour ratingthree I choose second update..

lensixteen ratingone I get million updates for the app and not one has improved it what so ever...

leneleven ratingone This is the most unfriendly app I have on my note 10.1.

lenten ratingone After every update, its still has alot of technical issues.

leneight ratingone Pooooor  trust mr dont download its a junk

lenten ratingthree Yes I have full bars for 4G or a WiFi connection.

lennine ratingfour Pix load faster & love ability to Share friends posts.

lenseven ratingfour For eg-view photos,profiles,videos etc.

lenfive ratingfour Edit: best update for far.

leneight ratingfour But this new update for android is amazing.

lenfive ratingone Comments and images load quick.

lenseven ratingone I like the little pop up windows.

lensix ratingthree Yup it's worth a short

lenthree ratingone Need more improvements..

lentwentyone ratingfour I had entirely given up on the app, then I heard about the rewrite and opted to give it a try.

lentwo ratingfour Super fast.

leneight ratingfour Fly outs are cool and don't lag.

lenseven ratingthree Work on that and 5 stars all day

lenfour ratingfour Otherwise it's fine.

leneight ratingfour The new update made it pretty much perfect

leneleven ratingone Don't u test these "updates" before u sent them out?

leneleven ratingone It would b nice if u worked out the bugs first....

leneight ratingone If I could give zero stars I would.

lennine ratingone This would be the 3rd time I installed this soon.

lensix ratingone getting tired of uninstalling then installing.

lenfour ratingone This update is bad..

lenfive ratingone Das ofensiv, im teling Fuckerbrug.

lenfourteen ratingone I think its going to work better with every uodate and its worse everytime!!!!!

lennine ratingfour Meet to ur friends tho see r very far

leneleven ratingone Was ok until i updated this app and now its useless.

lenthirteen ratingtwo I have to shut down and restart Facebook to get it working again.

leneight ratingtwo But browser and other internet apps work fine.

lenfive ratingfour Go ahead and download it!

lenthree ratingone The worst update!!!!

lensix ratingfour This is an most wonderful app

lenseven ratingthree If i select it i want it!

leneight ratingthree Overall newest update has helped with other issues.

lenthirteen ratingone Ok this update is cool and fast but what about the crashing problem!!

lenthree ratingone Worse facebook app :(

lenthree ratingfour More user friendly

leneleven ratingone Why change something that was working cone on FB fix it.

lentwentyfive ratingfour Keeps getting sooo close to 5 stars as soon as something I would like becomes integrated and the app gets updated, I feel I lose something.

leneight ratingfour Fix that back and it'll be 5 stars!

lentwentynine ratingone With this new update, it's not updating on its own, have to access the app every time to update it, silly update,has gone from bad to worse :@

lenfive ratingtwo Makes fb a bad expirience!

lentwentytwo ratingone with every update it gets worse do a down date back to the start of the year when this app actually worked

lenseven ratingone this new updates given a hard time.

lenten ratingone New updates are crap and almost nothing works properly anymore.

lenthirteen ratingthree I'll save the programmers the trouble and shoot myself in the head.

leneight ratingthree Don't download this, go for something else.

lenthree ratingthree Flipboard is better.  :-\

lenseventeen ratingtwo The new update is bullshit, the app was worth 4 stars in my oppinoin before the new update.

lentwo ratingone Bad update

lenseven ratingtwo Can u guys pls fix this ASAP?

lenten ratingtwo It's years  behind  in ui design compared with competition.

lenfive ratingtwo Same performance not much improvement.

lenseven ratingone Uninstalled and re-installed with no change.

lenten ratingone FB app dev : Don't fix what's not broken.

lentwo ratingone HORRIBLE APP..

leneight ratingone DON'T  WAIST YOUR TIME OR DATA DOWNLOADING !

lensix ratingone Why is Facebook still like this?

lenfive ratingfour Im thinking about deleting this

lentwentynine ratingone I've reached the point where I'm so frustrated with what is essentially a nonfunctional app that I'm almost ready to permanently remove it from my phone.

leneleven ratingone Too much "new" stuff on the app, not enough bug fixes.

lensix ratingfour hopeless new update is very poor

lennine ratingone Is Facebook scripts and aps written by 9 year olds?

lentwo ratingone Bravo Facebook.

lentwelve ratingone It is very sad to say that cant even update fb now.

lenthree ratingone All previous sucked.

lenseven ratingone Am really depressed by the fb makers.

lenfour ratingfour I like the facebook

lenthirteen ratingfour I have not had any problems with this app and I LOVE it!

lenseven ratingone And the stupid updates makes it worse :(

lensix ratingone This Update was a total disaster!

lentwenty ratingone What the hell is going on here now, its all gone belly up it's freaking laughable just awfull EXPERIENCE.

lenten ratingfour I've  a trouble when i want to update it ;)

lenthree ratingone Worst upgrade ever.

lenseven ratingone Fire all your engineers because they suck.

leneight ratingtwo Annoying to say the least, and borderline broken.

lenten ratingfour Its a great way to stay incontact with love ones.

lenthree ratingone Worst update ever...

lentwelve ratingone Im deleting the app and just using my web browser for fb.

leneight ratingone Whatever the update did screwed it all up.

leneight ratingone Will never download again until issues are handled

lentwo ratingone Terrible App!!!!

leneight ratingone Such a bullshit app from a big company.

lennine ratingone Please do something before I kill an innocent ant.

lensix ratingone Why dose bacon taste so good?

lentwentyone ratingone I guess you guys were upset that the last version was overall your best version, so you effed up the update..

lenfive ratingone Beginning to hate this app.

leneight ratingtwo That was one thing better than iPhone app!!

lenfive ratingone Each update causes more problems.

lenfive ratingfour Oh yah this amazing program

lenfive ratingone This is very bad app

lenfourteen ratingfour Love it love the lay out the new settings so much faster good job

leneight ratingfour Its ok but not too good to appreciate..

lenthree ratingone No bloody impressed.

lenfive ratingone Nd I have full service !!

lentwo ratingtwo Terribly glitchy.

leneight ratingone My fb has never been suckier than now.

lensixteen ratingone Facebook app always a problem on Android you think Facebook would figure this out by now.

lenten ratingone There's no problem wih my phone or interent connection.

leneighteen ratingone I never had any problems with the app until the update and I would think twice before updating!

lenthree ratingone Worst app ever!!!!!!

lenfour ratingfour Besides that works great

lenfive ratingone This new update is horrible...

lenseven ratingone I'm about to delete my account!!

lenseven ratingfour Love it as it gives fastest connectivity ...

leneight ratingone This Facebook app really needs alot if work.

leneleven ratingfour I will give five stars if the keep improving the app

lenthirteen ratingone why don't you try it yourself before you make the update available???

leneight ratingfour This is how I talk to my Niggia

lentwo ratingfour Excellent app

lenfourteen ratingfour I didn't find it as bad, its quite well functional in my xperia x10

lenseven ratingthree Its getting better since the last updated..

lenfive ratingone Was okay before the update.

lenfifteen ratingfour After the last update it has become fast and more easy to comment and like

lensix ratingfour Work much more better than before

lensix ratingtwo the update really is so poor..

lentwelve ratingtwo but on the other hand it is faster than the old version.

lensix ratingthree Fast loading is the best improvement.

leneleven ratingone Facebook is one of the most popular parts of modern America.

lennine ratingone How the Hell is this the worst app EVER?!?!?

lenfifteen ratingthree I have a Droid, so I don't know if iPhone users can do it.

lennine ratingone This update is worse than the already glitchy ap.

lensix ratingone Wish I could give minus stars

lenfive ratingfour Now is bag problem Facebook

lenfive ratingthree Seems quicker and more stable

lenseven ratingone nothink seems to work on this update

lensix ratingone Most popular site has worst app.

leneleven ratingtwo The new Facebook update is terrible (worse than the mobile site)!

lenseventeen ratingtwo They have taken out some of the good things that used to be in the previous updates;

lenseven ratingtwo Please add more on the next update.

lenfifteen ratingfour Updates do a bare minimum, or nothing at all, fixing none of the main problems.

lentwo ratingfour Absolutelly 5 stars.

lenten ratingthree It seems to work good now we'll see tho

leneleven ratingthree how can i sync facebook profile pics to my contacts list?
leneight ratingtwo need confirm yes no query when exiting app.
lensix ratingtwo keep pressing back key by mistake.
lensixteen ratingtwo cant select and copy text  cant save images easily like ios by long pressing on image
lennineteen ratingtwo its good app, but please make it to move to sd card as it consumes 30mb space on my phone.
lennine ratingone this app is so god awful, it offends me.
lensixteen ratingone facebooks has millions of dollars and your developers cant even release a half way decent app.
lensix ratingone now the app wont even load.
lenten ratingone get it together facebook, stop treating your members like crap!
lennineteen ratingone mu  i can't mention people i'm disappointed much bettet if i don't update it really sich
lenfive ratingone needs to be badly upgraded.
lentwentytwo ratingone photos rarely open, have to close the app to refresh it and even then most of the time it won't work.
lenfive ratingone needs a lot of work.
lensix ratingone just sucks in so many ways
lenthree ratingone its super slow!
lenseven ratingone never tells me when i have notifications.
lenfourteen ratingone it is so frustrating it has almost managed to put me off facebook altogether!

lenfourteen ratingone every time it updates it gets shitier and shitier now it just keeps crashing
lenseventeen ratingthree y is it that on iphone, users can save photos but from android phones it is impossible?
lenthirtyseven ratingthree even on another chat app, wechat, on their social media page, we can just tap and hold on the picture and the option of saving the photo pops up, just like how it is on ios is.

lenthree ratingtwo help needs fixed
lentwentyfour ratingone all i use facebook for anymore us keeping in touch with family, and i can't do that at all with this garbage app.

leneleven ratingone this is by far the worst upgrade i have ever had.

leneighteen ratingtwo very poor and so sick of the stupid frickin updates to fix one thing and feck up another!
lenseven ratingtwo keeps on freezing once and a while
lenthree ratingone it deserves 1 star (;
lenfour ratingtwo like really, really slow.
lenthirtyfive ratingone for example anyone running 4.1+ is in one group so a fb app just for that would address and fix issues for phones such as my note2 without compromising the functionality of phones with older android os
lentwentytwo ratingthree now all it needs is the abilities to share status', share to other people's walls and pages, and copy/paste function.
lenfourteen ratingthree i cant share to my own group, or anywhere but my own wall.ugh
leneleven ratingone show photo album name photo was uploaded to on facebook page
lenfive ratingone doesn't even work anymore.
lenten ratingone slow, crashes, easier to access facebook from my mobile browser.
lenthree ratingfive nice one 2 use
lensix ratingone facebook will not refresh my newsfeed.
lenfifteen ratingone i will manually refresh and it gets stuck on loading and will not display anything.
lenseven ratingone it freezes and crashes when browsing pics.
lentwelve ratingone also, this version will not let me delete a post or comment.
lensixteen ratingone i have to open it in a browser and go to full site to do that.
lensix ratingone needs a new update or something.
leneight ratingone its so slow and freezes all the time
lenthree ratingone its become unusable.
lentwo ratingone stupid facebook.
lennine ratingone my data connection is good with every other function.
lenfour ratingone fix this app please!
lenthirteen ratingthree it wont show my location when i post an update or upload picture.
lentwentyfour ratingthree it shows my location when i type but it disappeares once the update is posted and it just says 'via mobile'  please fix this.
lensix ratingtwo could use a lot of improving /:
lenfive ratingtwo always freezing up and foreclosing!
leneleven ratingone just downgraded to 1 star, wish there was a no star rating.
lenthirteen ratingone so many awful reviews from android users & still no reverse or new updates.
leneighteen ratingone first review was: another bugged app update that now won't load up comments or user home pages.
lenthree ratingone "network connection error".
lentwentyone ratingone for such a huge corporation you get no points for rolling out dysfunctional software and should be ashamed of your app.
lenfifteen ratingone never in my years of using facebook have i ever hsd so many network errors!
lenfive ratingone horrible and entirely to slow.
lentwo ratingfive great app
lensix ratingthree needs to speed up always  freezes
lenfour ratingthree seems to always freeze
lensix ratingfive use it , what else is ther ?
lentwelve ratingone unlike the previous version i lose text before i could post it.
lentwenty ratingone if you just happened to move your finger a touch any area outside of the comment box your text disappears.
lenseven ratingone the older version this didn't happen.
lentwo ratingfour awsme update
lenseventeen ratingthree keeps saying network error and, no network connection but i'm on wifi and my carrier network
leneight ratingone jesus updated and now i can't login
lentwo ratingone juz stupid
lentwo ratingfive good  update
leneleven ratingthree back button doesn't work when viewing images after last update
lentwo ratingfive nice application
leneight ratingthree this don't even let me log in.
lensix ratingthree it went from good to bad.
lenfour ratingthree it crashes every  second.
lentwo ratingthree fix please!
lenthirteen ratingthree force closes a lot doesnt have to delete comment pics sometimes take forever.
lenfive ratingfive superb app its very usefull.
leneight ratingone i cant even post statuses on here horrible
lenthirteen ratingone n the worse thing is ppl u dont like trys n adds u.
lenseven ratingone crashing all the time while viewing albums.
lentwo ratingone ok, seriously?
lennine ratingone instrad of adding new things, fix the old ones!
lentwo ratingone "network error"
lensix ratingone occurs a lot, pictures load slowly.
lenten ratingone most not at all, news feed doesnt show posts chronologically.
lenfourteen ratingone despite selected view, you can no longer acces links posted by friends & like pages.
lentwentyeight ratingone i would also like the option to edit my comments like the desktop version & be able to view archived messages within in the app,not the mobile site.
lentwentytwo ratingone also, please make it so i can move at least half of the app to the sd card, takes of major space!
leneighteen ratingone when commenting on a status or link if you touch your phone wrong it erases your entire comment.
lenfourteen ratingone when i type a status and click on post it dosent pist at all.
lenfour ratingone that is very aggravating.
lenseven ratingone i upload pictures and they dont post.

leneleven ratingone and it's constantly telling me that fb has quit "responding".
leneleven ratingthree better than previous versions, but still have to select "most recent"
lensix ratingthree every time i open the app.
lensix ratingthree please just show things in order!
lennine ratingfour there's a lot of things that needs improvement.
lenthirteen ratingfour one of them is that you can't even change your profile picture.
lensixteen ratingfour you should also have the option for being able to post pictures and videos on groups.
leneight ratingfour make this all work and you have 5 stars.
lentwelve ratingtwo how do you delete comments and unfollow posts in the new update?
lennineteen ratingtwo also it often takes ages to load photographs and the app says there is no connection when there is :(
lenfour ratingone sloppy and slow fix
lenthirtythree ratingone i had no problem wit updating my status to say near this city or near that city on my iphone 4s now i go back to android i have that problem fix it please
lentwentysix ratingthree it have it's hiccups from time to time but what i really don't like about this app is the amount of memory it use.
lenfourteen ratingthree if i could move it to my sd card i would rate it 5 stars.
lenfiftytwo ratingone not liking the new camera app, all they need to do is change the icon or the name, as i can see some people uploading not for public pics esp if they've had a bit to drink, why call it camera and make the icon look like a default camera app?
lenfive ratingtwo this app is really good
leneleven ratingone force close everytime when i try to open page of group.
lentwentyfive ratingthree i like the new fb, but im a little upset, because it takes for ever to load n refresh any page i am lookin at.
lenthree ratingone it never works!

lenseven ratingone very poor take forever to load comments
lennine ratingone always says error loading i just really hatee it
lenten ratingone two plus months and you refuse to fix the problem
lenseven ratingone no wonder ur stocks tanked so bad
lenthirteen ratingone seems to me ur app is for apple users not android users now
lentwentythree ratingthree since the update it is crazy hard and elaborate to create albums and upload pictures, which is 80% of what i use facebook for
lenfive ratingone pics take forever to load
lenthirteen ratingone 10  not changing # of stars and now still cant update the statuses as well
lentwelve ratingfour feels a bit sluggish when scrolling ;( but the speed has defiantly increased
lentwentytwo ratingfour the truth of the matter is facebook needs to put the same effort they put into ios that they put into android
leneight ratingone i uninstalled then reinstalled, worked like a champ
lennine ratingtwo using too much internal memory everytime you release updates
lenthree ratingfive uygulama s¨¹per hatta baz
lensix ratingfive berbat diyo ben galaxy mini kullan
lenthree ratingone bad bad bad
lentwentysix ratingone 1 in galaxy s3 n i hav kept option of chat availabiliy on during using the facebook app but i never appears online to my friends plz help
lenfive ratingone hi i m usin facebook 2
lentwentysix ratingone 1 in galaxy s3 n i hav kept option of chat availabiliy on during using the facebook app but i never appears online to my friends plz help
lenfour ratingfour a great ux overall
lenthirtyfour ratingfour but we could really use a few fixes like clicking the apps from the sidebar opens them in play store rather than opening the app itself (this happened when i tried to open soundcloud )
lenseven ratingthree because of uploading speed is very slow
lenten ratingone the worst after the last update, if you log off
leneight ratingone i hope the first virsion to be returned
lenseven ratingone im, like most people, a facebook addict
lensix ratingone wont even connect half the time
lensixteen ratingtwo when i try to back up out of a picture i have to press back 5 times
lentwelve ratingtwo sometimes when i opened the app its hang then go to crash
lenfour ratingtwo stay with previous version
lenthirtysix ratingthree if you have hundreds of friends who post a lot, the news feed keeps resetting every few seconds and you can never finish scrolling down to read the statuses before it goes back to the top
lenten ratingfive all works are automatically done here and automstic udates etc
lenfive ratingfive thnx fb snd thnx android
leneight ratingthree is anyone else havin problems with pictures loading
lentwentyfour ratingone it would be more efficient to engrave a rock and kick it over to their mailbox as to attempt to comment, like, or etc
lensix ratingone i can not change profile picture
lentwelve ratingone won't post updates the first time, have to copy, paste, repost
leneight ratingone are you purposely making this app suck balls
lensix ratingone sometimes it won't even load
leneleven ratingone pics don't load, comments don't load, won't refresh
lenseven ratingone everytime i try to use this app
lenfour ratingone stop making bad updates
lentwelve ratingtwo i keep jumping from yourself app to face book on the internet
lenseven ratingtwo either way your product is seriously frustrating
lenseven ratingtwo your app frequently doesn't allow comments
lennine ratingtwo the internet product ignores all my block settings etc
leneleven ratingtwo i am seriously thinking of not bothering anymore with mobile facebook
lenfive ratingone can't change cover picture
lentwentysix ratingfour i have apparently not the latest version of facebook app on my android device as it keeps trying to update it, but it says "unsufficient storage"
lentwenty ratingfour which is false, i do have a lot of storage available, and it's the online app to not update
lensixteen ratingfour all others have been updated with no problem, and fb keeps saying this for 2 weeks now
lenseven ratingone the simpler facebook was fast and easy
lensixteen ratingone do away with timeline also no video that is posted by my phone or anyone elses
lenten ratingone i know this stuff takes time but come on already
lensix ratingone app crashes when viewing photos etc

lenseven ratingone i keep getting a no network connection
leneight ratingfour terrible,cant post,glitches every time i try
lensixteen ratingfour would give it zero due to having to uninstall or reboot and hope for the best
lenfour ratingfour fatally flawed this version
lenthree ratingthree consume more spacee
leneleven ratingone network error always though i have a excellent signal from wifi
leneleven ratingthree after first download everything works great but then pics dont show
lenfour ratingthree uninstalled app and reinstalled
lenfifteen ratingthree then after awhile pics disappearing installing and reinstalling is really  annoying and please fix this
lenten ratingfive n the pop upm notifications on the taskbar are awesome
lenfive ratingone don't want this bull
lenfive ratingtwo i bought a galaxy note 10
lensixteen ratingtwo 1 tablet hoping tbat facebook would be far easier to use when away from my laptop/desktop
lenseventeen ratingtwo sadly it's fair to say that the latest version of facebook on a samsung galaxy note 10
lenthirteen ratingtwo 1 is probably one of the worse experiences that i've had to endure
lennineteen ratingone i have these little white boxes everywhere and it won't let me get to my timeline, messages, etc
lenthirteen ratingone can pls pls pls fix the bugs on the fb app for android
lensix ratingone :(( using sony ericsson by the way
leneleven ratingone basically all i can do is scroll through the news feed
lenfive ratingone cant even check my notifications
leneleven ratingtwo 90% of the time when i click on a picture, it says
lennine ratingtwo it can not retrieve the photo at this time
lennine ratingone no location is recorded when posting a status update
lensix ratingone cantt upload pictures and post pictures
lensix ratingone eats lot of memory and battery
lenthirteen ratingone using the browser is much better than the app :p unistalling the app
leneight ratingone latest update is completely a piece of shit
lenseven ratingthree ok app but need to fix some
lenthirteen ratingone always in waiting mode, pics won't show up, posts don't post

lenthree ratingtwo likes & comments delayed
lensix ratingone cannot see notifications from weeks ago

lenthree ratingone app lags alot
leneight ratingone update should be better not make it worst
leneight ratingone it doesn't upload my status nor pictures
lenten ratingone really annoying that i can only upload pictures from instagram
lennineteen ratingtwo things cause it will unlike can't change timeline pic, slow & takes to long to load & look at pics
lenfourteen ratingone now when i upload pics i get an error yet the picture still uploads
lentwenty ratingone it doesn't refresh the way it used to, the location disappeared, and it's very delayed when sending notifications
lensix ratingone facebook apps is not responding right
lennine ratingone i can't post status on my wall now
lenfourteen ratingone what's the point of using the app if you can't see pictures
lenten ratingone i cant see pics, its slower && makes my phone sloww -
lentwentyone ratingone gonna delete      somehere, probably when i last updated fbook, the app autochecked the box for auto updates, which i never do
lennineteen ratingone ever since the last update i can't are any pix on the news feed or my profile page
lensix ratingone the cell tower thing is cute
leneight ratingthree keeps crashing when looking at pics and events
lentwentyone ratingthree :/ takes ages to get back on it and sometimes i have to restart my tab to get it to work again
lenten ratingtwo jusy updated the app and now it wont even load
lentwelve ratingone just can't post anything whether it be a photo or status
lenseven ratingone i'm trying to uninstall n reinstall
lenfive ratingone hasn't loaded for days
lenseventeen ratingone f'n ridiculous can't even use it for more than 5 minutes before it force closes ;c
leneighteen ratingone it also only gives me my others notifications when you i clear my data/force stop the application
lenseven ratingone mobile pictures or only on old albums
leneight ratingone half of my news feed doesn't appear
lensix ratingone i can't view comment threads
lentwentyseven ratingthree I never posted a low review of the Facebook app before because even though it didn't do everything I wanted it to, at least it worked.
lentwo ratingfour Excellent app.....
leneight ratingone When this app went native, it was fine.
lensix ratingone Two updates afterwards, its HORRIBLE again.
leneleven ratingone The worst app I've ever had the displeasure of downloading.
lenseven ratingone Surely it should be better than this?
lenfour ratingone This last update sucks!
lenfour ratingone I hate this app.
leneighteen ratingthree if I use facebook on my phone but with the browser not the app everything shows up fine
leneight ratingone Didnt even want to give it one star.
lenten ratingtwo But a good in disguise is the page loads faster
lenseven ratingone not satisfied with the app right now
lenfour ratingtwo This app is garbage.
lenthree ratingone Worst update ever..
lentwentyone ratingfour After using this on the Droid X, CyanogenMod 7 and 10 (Nook color), and Droid Razr HD, still product seems stable for me.
lennine ratingfour I love facebook i wil never stop using facebook
lenfour ratingone This app is beat.
lenfive ratingone The last verison was better.
leneight ratingone Everything worked fine until about a week ago.
leneight ratingone After an update it becames annoying and useless...
lenfive ratingfour Nothing more need Be said.
lennine ratingone You cant change it evertime its updated it sucks.
lenseven ratingone Why fix something that wasn't broken??
lenthree ratingone Facebook app sucks!
lenthree ratingone Worse update ever
lenten ratingone restarted phone still no work I am seriously not happy!
lenthree ratingone Doesn't update.
lenseven ratingone I'm using the web page now.
lennine ratingone How long will it take to fix this bug????
lentwentyfour ratingone I can only assume that a company with the resources of FB would release an app when it does what they want it to.
lennineteen ratingone Which leads to the  question of why would you want to release an app that's a complete mess?
lenthree ratingone Lousy Share implementation?
lensix ratingone shame they call it an update!!!
lentwo ratingone Seriously unhappy.
leneight ratingthree In a MOBILE app that is incredibly lame.
lennine ratingone The past two upgrades have made Facebook run horribly.
lennine ratingone Please revert to old version that actually was reliable.
lenthirteen ratingtwo This update is taking years to open due to this airtime is wasting....
lentwelve ratingfour I really good for people who are not on computers a lot.
lenseventeen ratingthree App is very sluggish does what it's supposed to but with every update it gets worse.
leneight ratingone Earlier version was little bit faster than this..
lenfive ratingone It should be corrected asap..
lentwo ratingone Updates sucks...
lenten ratingone You are currently the #1 social networking site in the world...
lennine ratingone im deleting my account if this isn't fixed!!!!
lensix ratingone Very bad, fix all the bugs!!!!!!
lensix ratingtwo u guys nid to fix this!
lennine ratingthree This app is just a wrapper for the website.
lenfifteen ratingthree If you want to satisfy users (and raise your stock prices) fix your mobile apps.
lenten ratingthree Otherwise people may move to google+, which is gaining ground.
lenthirteen ratingthree Mobile browsing is now bigger than computer browsing, and your screwing it up.
lenthree ratingone Time to UNINSTALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lenfour ratingone I hate fb app..
lensix ratingtwo It's a very irritating app.
lenfive ratingtwo That may lose your temper.
lenfifteen ratingone So facebook, you had a really good update so why'd you make another one?
lenfive ratingone Facebook is really crappy now.
lenseven ratingone It was working fine until I updated.
leneight ratingone It's better to access fb via browser...
lenfifteen ratingone There are no regular updates from d developers even d updates didn't change much..
lentwenty ratingone Yes, I use Facebook, but there are better alternatives for using it on Android, thanks to FB's developers API.
lenfive ratingone Wait for the next version.
lensix ratingone This most recent update is AWFUL.
lentwentyseven ratingtwo The privacy invasion of this app make me often use the fb site from my phone b/c of the list of when everyone was last on.
leneight ratingone you guys fix a problem n create another.
lensix ratingone update made it worster thn evr.......
lenten ratingone one of the must commonly used apps that people use.
lentwo ratingone CHOPPER EXCHANGE.
leneight ratingone Fix it or im getting rid of it.
lenseven ratingone Thougth updates were supposed to improve things?????
lenseven ratingtwo I'm sick of this crap app.
lentwo ratingtwo seriously Mark!!
lenfive ratingone it worked besutifully for awhile.
lenten ratingone These kind of errors should not be happening from Facebook.
lenfifteen ratingfour Now I can go to Facebook with out searchon the internet and it is faster .
lenfour ratingone It behaves like malware.
leneight ratingone Please fix because overall the app is great.
lensix ratingtwo I do not like this "update."
lensixteen ratingfour Its better than gettin on the internet when you could just get on it on demand
lensix ratingone Looking forward to it being fixed.
lenthree ratingtwo Great on iphones?!
lenseven ratingtwo Please fix this issue for android users!!!
lenfourteen ratingone So I'm re installing it, hopefully it'll actually let me go on.
lennine ratingone This has to be the worst app i have...
lennine ratingone Agree with all the bad reviews of this app.
lenseven ratingone The last update made the app useless.
lenten ratingone My girlfriend has the same issue on her nexus s.
lenten ratingone Fix it bc I'm about to delete the app.
leneight ratingthree Upgraded my phone, have a Samsung Galaxy S2 now.
lenfifteen ratingthree It still gives me problems once in awhile, but not enough to uninstall the app.
leneleven ratingone I always send the error report and obviously nothing gets fixed.
lenfive ratingone Such a piece of krap.
lennine ratingone Im about to not even use fb any more
leneight ratingone Almost speechless on how bad this app is...!
lensix ratingtwo pls fix this bug FB team..
lenfive ratingone hope you guys fix it...
lentwo ratingone Poor app
lenten ratingone Test connection on browser or other apps, everything is ok.
lennine ratingone This is a critical bug, pls fix it soon.
lennine ratingone So many updates and none have fixed the problem.
lentwenty ratingone Yeah, i don't want to look at photos anyways, so your app is pretty helpful in that regard (sarcasms).
leneight ratingone You are making it into a bad app!
lennine ratingone This app is getting worse and worse each day.
lentwelve ratingthree This app has improved however, it still has a way to go.
lenthirteen ratingthree I long for an app with the stability and functionality of the website.
lensix ratingthree Keep up the progress developer team.
lenfour ratingone Needs an update asap.....
lensix ratingtwo Every update gets worse and worse...
lennine ratingthree Fix this and we'll all be much happier.
lenseven ratingone The most recent update is so awful.
leneleven ratingone The update before the most recent was by far the best.
lentwelve ratingone I dont see how the updates make tis app better of faster.
lensix ratingtwo Doesnt let me update the app!
leneight ratingtwo Facebook and google need to start getting along.
lenthree ratingfour Fb is great
lennine ratingtwo I am uninstalling this app and going to Friendcaster.
lentwelve ratingone Only way to fix for me was to un install the app.
lennine ratingone Fb for android is consistently getting worse and worse.
lenseven ratingone I mean seriously people fix it already.
leneleven ratingone Don't know why it works this way, but very annoying.
lenthree ratingone Worst update ever.
lenfour ratingone Need a new update!
lenfive ratingtwo Pretty crappy for galaxy siii
lenten ratingone Stop trying to make money and make your apps work?
lenseven ratingone Always something with this piece of crap..
lennineteen ratingfour I was trying to uninstall my facebook app because it was so crappy when I came across this update.
lenseven ratingfour I absolutely love my facebook app now!
lenseven ratingfour No more mobile internet Facebook  for me;-)
lenfour ratingone App is useless now!
lensix ratingone You had that in previous versions.
lentwelve ratingone Every new update comes with a new error to the facebook app
lenthirteen ratingthree The Facebook App is improved from before, I enjoy the faster picture loading.
lenten ratingtwo but we all know FB would never be that considerate.
lentwo ratingone Pathetic update
lentwentynine ratingone This piece of carp app is sheet it's forking frustrating it was fine when they originally released the major update but now it's a piece of sheet.
lenfive ratingone Fix your sheet Facebook developers.
lenseven ratingone I prefer use my old facebook app....
leneight ratingthree Other then that its still a great app.
lenten ratingtwo Commenting on a photo from mobile is good and working ...
lennine ratingtwo need a solution for this A. S. A. P
lenfive ratingone Look I''ll be honest.....
leneight ratingone I like the new look, feel and features....
leneleven ratingone No matter the update, it never works right on my phone.
lenthree ratingone This app sucks!!!
leneight ratingone And is there anyway to contact the developers?
lenfour ratingone And is completely annoying.
lentwo ratingfour nice apps....
leneight ratingfour Facebook on android is getting poorer and poorer!
lenseven ratingfour $60billion company can't get an app right!
lensix ratingfour Significant improvement since version 1.0 or so.
lenfour ratingtwo You're getting there...
lenten ratingone Pleaseee FIX and will rate again based on the fix.
leneight ratingtwo I am totally fed up after updating it...
lensix ratingtwo The last version was much better...
lenthirteen ratingone I don't like it at all, I want the old version please!!
lenten ratingone Cmon guys I know you can do better than this.
lenthree ratingone THIS UPDATE SUCKS!!!!!
lenfourteen ratingone I WOULD ACTUALLY PAY MONEY TO DELETE THIS UPDATE, I HATE IT THIS MUCH!!!!
leneight ratingtwo With every update the app gets worse & worse..
lensix ratingone Last view updates have been junk.
leneighteen ratingone Apparently you all just don't have time for us or have the courtesy to fix our problems.
lenfive ratingone I'm uninstalling this app..
lenfive ratingfour People just need to relax.
lenthirteen ratingfour It is not going to be able to do everything a computer can.
leneight ratingfour The app itself has gotten a lot faster.
lenseven ratingfour But that is not facebook's fault.
lenseven ratingfour Love the features they are adding too.
lenseven ratingone Just updated this app and guess what?
lenfour ratingone This app just SHITY!!!!!!
lenthirteen ratingone The app is free, I would hate to have to pay for it!!!!!!
lennine ratingone Agree with everything every one else had said here.
lennine ratingone I recommend others not to update to this version.
lenfour ratingthree A little bit Better
lenthirteen ratingthree What's the point in that feature if it's wrong every time!?
lensix ratingfour Am in luv with this app
lenthirteen ratingthree The new updated version of FB is freaking the nuts out of me.
lentwenty ratingthree If I'm putting a comment against a pic or an update, why the hell can't I remove it??
lenthirteen ratingone I think its time to go back to basics because this app sucks.
lenten ratingfour App is way easier to use  than my Web browser
lentwo ratingone Bad update
leneight ratingthree Better than previous updates, but still not great.
lensixteen ratingthree It's working today but I've learned not to update if it can be helped.
